# Unicode Cards

A fun little app that turns Unicode characters into trading cards. Browse through Latin and Greek/Cyrillic character sets displayed as TCG-style cards with different rarity levels.

## What it does

- Displays Unicode characters as trading cards with rarities (Common, Rare, Epic, Mythic, Legendary)
- Switch between Latin and Greek+Cyrillic character sets
- Toggle font styles (bold, italic, serif) to see character variations

## Character sets

- **Latin**: 317 characters
- **Greek + Cyrillic**: 321 characters

*Note: Character rarities were subjectively chosen based on personal preference and have no real basis - I simply assigned rarities to characters I thought were cool.*
